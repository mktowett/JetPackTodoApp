Jetpack is a suite of libraries, tools, and guidance to help developers write high-quality apps easier. These components help you follow best practices, free you from writing boilerplate code, and simplify complex tasks, so you can focus on the code you care about.

Jetpack comprises the `androidx.*` package libraries, unbundled from the platform APIs. This means that it offers backward compatibility and is updated more frequently than the Android platform, making sure you always have access to the latest and greatest versions of the Jetpack components.

Our official AARs and JARs binaries are distributed through [Google Maven](https://maven.google.com).

You can learn more about using it from [Android Jetpack landing page](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).
